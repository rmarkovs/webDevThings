    <h2> Expected Graduation: May 2021 Desired Title: Software Engineer </h2>
        <p>Hello! Thanks for checking out my website! I’m Rebecca, and I’m graduating in May 2021 with a degree in bioinformatics. My main interests are biomedical
technology and medicine in general, although I have a specific interest in <a href=“https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/“> machine learning </a> and <a href=“https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence”> artificial intelligence</a>
I have taken multiple seminars on both, with a specific focus on machine learning and I loved it! I plan on getting my masters in computer science with a
Concentration in AI and ML after I complete my bachelors degree. </p>
        <p>Outside of school I like to rock climb, crochet, knit, set, paint, draw, and snowboard. I also work as a muy Thai and kickboxing instructor. </p>
